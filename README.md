## 🚀 About Me

I am a frontend engineer focused on **architecture, scalability, and long-term product thinking**.

My goal is to transition into a **Tech Lead role**, owning technical direction, mentoring engineers, and designing systems that scale with business growth.

I work at the intersection of:

- Product thinking  
- System design  
- Performance engineering  
- Clean, maintainable architecture

## 🧠 Technical Leadership Mindset

✔ Designing frontend architectures for scale  
✔ Making business-aware technical decisions  
✔ Mentoring & reviewing code  
✔ Improving performance & developer experience  
✔ Structuring projects for long-term maintainability  

I believe strong frontend architecture is a competitive advantage.
